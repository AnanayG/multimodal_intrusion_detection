# Ultra Low Power Person Detection with MultiModal Wakeup Hierarchy for Battery-Powered Security Cameras
This project implements person detection by combining a PIR motion sensor and a monochrome image sensor, aimed at reducing the uptime of primary security camera for recording. All inferences are done at the edge using TensorFlow Lite, applying TinyML techniques such as quantization and pruning. The system is built on an off-the-shelf microcontroller: XIAO ESP32S3 from SEEED Studio.
