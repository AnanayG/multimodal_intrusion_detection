# Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective

Home security cameras have been increasingly popular due to their effectiveness in deterring criminal activities, including burglary and property theft. However, conventional wired surveillance systems are often difficult to set up and can result in excessive, unnecessary energy usage. In this project, we propose an ultra-low-power human detection system with a multimodal wakeup hierarchy, designed for battery-powered security cameras. This approach enables the system to enter a sleep mode and only activates upon detecting human activities, drastically reducing energy consumption.

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations

Battery-operated consumer surveillance products in the market today often present three main issues: privacy concerns associated with cloud-based data processing, poor battery life due to frequent system wakeups, and the requirement of a costly monthly subscription. Past attempts at ultra-low-power person detection primarily relied on specialized hardware designs, which are costly to deploy and inflexible for updates.

## 3. Novelty & Rationale

Our approach combines the use of an always-on PIR sensor and a low-power monochrome image sensor to perform person detection locally at the edge, eliminating privacy concerns from offloading the data to the cloud
