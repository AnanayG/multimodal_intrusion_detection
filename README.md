# Ultra Low Power Person Detection with MultiModal Wakeup Hierarchy for Battery-Powered Security Cameras
Person deteciton using a PIR motion sensor and a monochrome image sensor in order to minimize main security camera uptime. Person detection done at the edge with CNN using TinyML techniques inaddition to some traditional CV techniques for light preprocessing. Platform use is off-the-shelf microcontroller XIAO ESP32S3 by SEEED Studio.
